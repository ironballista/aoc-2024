# Advent of Code 2024

This repo hosts my solutions for 2024's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024).
I cannot guarantee the quality of any of my code, but I might as well make it publicly available; my primary goal this year is to practice my Rust skills again.

## Directory Structure

- Under `assets/`, you'll find input files for each day's problem.
- `src/lib.rs` contains all of the business logic. Currently, I am shoving every day's functions into a single Rust file; this organization is subject to change in the near future.
- `src/main.rs` contains very little code simply meant to run whatever function I currently need. I will, hopefully, figure out a better, more modular structure over the course of the month to build a separate binary for each day's problems, compare different implementations, etc.
